## Versions

This project original started out as a [Adobe Flash][flash] project written in [ActionScript 3][as3] and was documented briefly in this [blog post][blog].

Since then I have begun porting it to [ECMAScript 6][es6] transpiled with [Babel][babel] to target [HTML5][html5].

The source code for both versions are available on their respective branches.
